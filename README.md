# surfs_up

## Overview

During this analysis, we were able to go from helping others to helping ourselves by going further in our career to the point to start a new entrepreneurship, a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of Awahoo, Hawaii. However, starting a new business needs not only money, time, and effort, but a great knowledge to identify if our idea is in the correct time and place, and people who trust our idea enough to decide to invest in it. W. Avy, an investor passionate about surfing and Hawaii, is going to help us in the process of getting more investors and making this dream come true.

## Results

In order to achieve this goal, W. Avy asked us to do an analysis of the weather and get the statistics from the months of June and December since the climate in this area changes constantly and it will be better to have a look at what we will be facing over the whole year beforehand.

* First, there are more references points in June (1,700 points) than in December (1,517 points), which means that June is a month where we can expect major climate changes.

* Moreover, December has less spread out weather changes by having a mean of 71.04 F. and a median of 71 F. June, on the contrary, has a mean of of 74.94 F. and a median of 75 F.

* Furthermore, the min and max temperatures that can be reached during June are 64 F. and 85 F. respectively, while during December the min and max temperatures that can be reached are 56 F. and 83 F. respectively.

## Summary

As part of giving W.Avy the best material and information possible about the Surf and Shake shop, we have created two more queries with tables that represent the precipitation calculation for the months of June and December.

* In June, we can see that the minimum and maximum inches of precipitation go from 0.00 to 4.43 respectively and the average precipitation is 0.13 inches.

* In December, we can see that the minimum and maximum inches of precipitation are 0.00 and 6.42 respectively and the average precipitation is about 0.21 inches.

All these tables not only show us how different the climate changes during different seasons of the year are but that during any month of the year we want to start our project, we will already know what climate changes we'll be facing and how to turn any disadvantage into an advantage for the new store.
