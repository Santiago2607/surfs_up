## Overview

During this analysis, we were able to go from helping others to helping ourselves by going further in our career to the point to start a new entrepreneurship, a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of Awahoo, Hawaii. However, starting a new business needs not only money, time, and effort, but a great knowledge to identify if our idea is in the correct time and place, and people who trust our idea enough to decide to invest in it. W. Avy, an investor passionate about surfing and Hawaii, is going to help us in the process of getting more investors and making this dream come true.

## Results

In order to achieve this goal, W. Avy asked us to do an analysis of the weather and get the statistics from the months of June and December since the climate in this area changes constantly and it will be better to have a look at what we will be facing over the whole year beforehand.

* First, there are more references points in June (1,700 points) than in December (1,517 points), which means that June is a month where we can expect major climate changes.
